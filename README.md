# cumulative-learning

We are releasing the ground truth annotations in MOT file format for the following datasets:

 - MusicDataset: converted from the official release
 - BigBangTheory: converted from the official release (original_gt files) and a version we manually annotated including all the actors not previously annotated. For each identity we included the values (#id, name, first appearance, # frames from first episode) inside the file names_to_id
 - Motinas Multi Face Dataset: manually annotated Ground Truth using OpenCV CVAT tool
